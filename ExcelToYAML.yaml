While it's not directly equivalent to Net Promoter Score (NPS), both metrics aim to measure customer (or patient) satisfaction and loyalty.Although the HCAHPS survey doesn't include the NPS question exactly, the question "Would you recommend this hospital to your friends and family?" is similar in nature and could be considered an equivalent to the NPS question within the context of hospital care. The responses to this question can give a sense of the hospital's performance in terms of patient loyalty and satisfaction, similar to NPS.

          **Description**: This metric calculates the hours that patients spent in seclusion for every 1,000 hours of patient care.Seclusion is the practice of confining a patient in a room or area from which they are physically prevented from leaving. Like physical restraint, the use of seclusion is generally minimized in healthcare settings and is typically used only when less restrictive methods have been unsuccessful and there's an immediate risk of harm to the patient or others.

          **Description**: This metric is the percentage of visits self-scheduled by patients in MyChart. Visits scheduled by patients are more efficient and patients are able to choose the time that works best.  The numerator is the number of visits that were self-scheduled online via MyChart. The denominator is the number of visits enabled for self-scheduling online via MyChart using direct or ticket scheduling workflows. Only visits enabled for direct scheduling and ticket scheduling are included in the denominator. Ticket scheduling is only enabled for appointments at hospital outpatient departments.

          **Description**: This metric is the average time (in days) between admission and discharge for each relevant inpatient encounter.  This excludes: 1. Preadmission ADT patient status 2. Admission statuses outside complete or confirmed 3. Open, voided, and combined HAR statuses 4. HAR types that are not HB/Mixed 5. Newborn DRG Codes 6. Encounters with missing GMLOS values 7. Outlier LOS Encounters (greater than 180 days in length) 8. Any patient class that is not InpatientThis average can provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of care, as well as the types of conditions being treated. A shorter length of stay may indicate more efficient care, but it could also reflect a focus on treating less severe conditions that require less time in the hospital. A longer length of stay could indicate difficulties of transferring patients to rehab, skilled nursing facility, or long term care.

The numerator is the count of unique complications for all Clinical Clusters that occurred.  The expected complication value is calculated using the Midas Risk Adjusted Model for all Clinical Clusters. A value greater than 1.0 indicates the complication rate is worse than expected.  Values less than 1.0 indicates the complication rate is better than expected.
