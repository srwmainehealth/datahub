          **Description**: This is the percentage of unique patients that were seen in the 12 months prior to the end of the summary interval in a completed face-to-face encounter that were MyChart active at the end of the summary interval.     Completed encounters are those with  a calculated encounter status of 2 - Completed.    Face-to-face encounters are those configured to be face-to-face in Slicer Dicer system definitions, and those configured as face-to-face with a high-level provider point value of 10 in Ambulatory License  Count configuration settings. Hospital encounters are always considered face-to-face. Appointments (encounter type 50) are not considered face-to-face for this metric because we consider them to be future or no show appointments.    Encounters are exclu ded if their start date falls between an admission and discharge date of an admission for the patient, including admissions that are active when the metric runs.     Patients are only considered for a summary interval if they are living at the end of the  summary interval. Only valid patients are included.     The date of the encounter is calculated as the first of the following to have a value: hospital discharge date, effective date

          **Description**: This metric tracks the percent of Admit, Sign-In, Check-In and Check-Out workflows completed without any warnings being bypassed. The metric only considers a workflow the first time it is successfully completed for that encounter. For example, when a use r first checks in a patient to see the doctor, whether or not they bypass any warnings will be tracked, but if the user subsequently reenters the Check-In workflow and changes some data, whether or not they bypass warnings then will not be tracked. Simil arly, if a user enters the Check-In workflow to try and check in a patient, but then exits the workflow without checking the patient in, whether or not they bypass warnings will not be tracked.    Warnings are not tracked if they are excluded from this m etric in confirmation record settings.

This is calculated by dividing the number of MSPQs completed by the number of MSPQs prese nted in registration workflows. When viewing this metric at the user level, an MSPQ will only count once per user per day. When viewing this metric at any of the facility structure summary levels, an MSPQ will only count once. In this scenario, we will a ttribute the MSPQ to the day it was completed. If the MSPQ was not completed, we will attribute it to the last day it was presented to a registrar.

          **Description**: This metric tracks on time starts percentage for first cases.    A case is considered first if it is scheduled to start within the first case time range defined in the Report Definitions 1 form in the System/Location settings. A case is considered late i f the difference between the scheduled start time and the actual in room time is greater than zero minutes. No add-on case is considered towards this metric. Furthermore, if the first case in the time range for a room is an add-on, no case will be consid ered first for that room.     A case is considered an add-on if it is added to the schedule after the schedule is finalized according to the Scheduling 2 form in the System/Location settings.    The numerator for this metric is the first cases that are n ot late. The denominator is all first cases.    This metric relies on settings in System/Location definitions. Ensure that the needed definitions are set in Scheduling 2, Timing Event Mapping, and Report Definitions 1 forms.

If a turnover is adjacent to an add- on case, that turnover is excluded from this metric. Turnovers greater than 60 minutes are excluded from this metric. Turnovers with a scheduled gap greater than 0 minutes are excluded. The scheduled gap is the duration between the scheduled cleanup comp lete of the previous case to the scheduled setup start of the following case.

Case in room time is matched first both in the room the case happened in then other rooms in the same location, then setup/c leanup time is matched next to any remaining open time, first in the room the case happened in then other rooms in the same location. The denominator is the total number of minutes that are in primetime while the schedule has Open Time for all rooms in t he OR location. Unavailable time is excluded for any unavailable reason.    Cases are considered to be in room based on case tracking events mapped in the Timing Event Mapping form in System/Location definitions. The turnover time is calculated from the  number of minutes from the Out of Room event from the previous case to the In Room event of the subsequent case. When this duration exceeds 60 minutes, 60 minutes is used instead. Primetime is defined in the Shift Settings form in the System/Location def initions. Templates are managed in the Edit Template activity. This metric excludes holidays. For the numerator, cases in rooms that are inactive, virtual or excluded due to organizational room exclusions are ignored. Cases that are voided, have an inval id patient, or are associated with an order marked for the wrong patient are ignored. For the denominator, rooms that are inactive, virtual or excluded due to organizational room exclusions are ignored.

This is tracked as a percentage of patients with a temperature near Anesthesia Stop greater than or equal to 95.9 �F (35.5 �C) out of the total population with anesthesia time greater than or equal  to 60 minutes that have general or neuraxial anesthesia. A higher percentage is better for this metric, and it is enabled for benchmarking.  Emergent records and those with intentional hypothermia are excluded if the measure isn't met.    This metric do es not rely on CPT codes so it is not equivalent to MIPS 424.    Anesthesia time is the duration between Anesthesia Start and Anesthesia Stop. Near Anesthesia Stop is 30 minutes before Anesthesia Stop to 15 minutes after Anesthesia Stop.
