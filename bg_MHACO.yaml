          **Description**: Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) represents an individual's medical complexity, or acuity, in the form of financial risk.  It is important that providers and payers have a clear understanding of the complexities of the population as a criticalmeasure to evaluate performance, set benchmarks, etc. Risk Adjustment models can vary widely and be used in many different contexts including financial models, quality models, and accountable care organizations.  For MHACO, we use the Risk Adjustment models provided by ARCADIA, specifically the CMS-HCC v24 model which aligns with the medicare population.  The risk data includes demographic risk scores, current and historical claims and encounters.
