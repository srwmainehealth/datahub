      **KPI?**: \n**Description**: This field estimates each provider's clinical FTE\
      \ based primarily on total calculated hours of availability from the office\
      \ scheduling data. For example, if a provider's first appointment last Monday\
      \ was scheduled to start at 7:30a (excludes cancellations), last appointment\
      \ was scheduled at 3:30p for 30 minutes (so end time was 4:00p), with a scheduled\
      \ break from 12:00p to 1:00p, then total availability was 7.5 hours for that\
      \ particular day. InflowHealth calculates these daily values and adds the hours\
      \ for each day over the past year, month or quarter to arrive at total available\
      \ office hours for that provider for that time period. The formula then makes\
      \ any necessary adjustments to account for services and RVUs that are not captured\

      \ other providers, it is assumed that the office scheduling data alone does\
      \ not provide an accurate estimate of total available hours, so a value is not\

      **KPI?**: \n**Description**: InflowHealth is used by medical groups across the\
      \ United States representing data for more than 50,000 providers. With a standardized\
      \ data feed and consistent data definitions, this data is blinded and aggregated\
      \ into a benchmark database. Unlike other industry \"benchmarks\", the InflowHealth\
      \ calculations are standardized (not self-reported) and are updated every month,\
      \ giving near real-time insight into dozens of metrics across more than 200\
      \ specialties and subspecialties.    This particular field is populated, at\
      \ a provider level, with the national median value for \"Core Support FTEs per\
      \ Effective Provider FTE\" from the database for that provider's specialty.\
      \ InflowHealth defines Core Support as individuals whose job codes have been\
      \ mapped as Clinical Support, Patient Access, Patient Accounting, Finance &\
      \ Accounting, or General Management. This means that, once the values have been\
      \ aggregated into cost centers, the values that appear in this field have been\
      \ fully weighted to account for the actual provider FTEs and specialties working\
      \ in each of your medical group's cost centers. No other industry data provides\
      \ this level of accuracy.    In instances where the database does not have sufficient\
      \ sample sizes for a given specialty, or for specialties that do not typically\
      \ have support staffing (for example hospital based providers), this field automatically\
      \ assumes that your current staffing level for that specialty is appropriate,\
      \ and populates this field with that value.  \n"
